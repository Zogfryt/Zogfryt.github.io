### Shortly about me:

I'm a poor little student who is living STILL with his parents with a hope of achieving somothing great in the future.

Of course the main problem is passing the studies but i think that with hard work and a bit of luck i can manage this :cold_sweat:

### Skills

For now my skillset isn't satysfying, but hey I'm a student i'm still learning :neutral_face:

I can program a bit in C++ and i'm learning C now

Math has been always my domain but studies showed that it's not entirely true :sweat_smile:

And....**Somehow** i passed FCE in English, but shh..

### Project

Currently i'm making a project with my friends so if you have some spare time go and
