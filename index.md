### Shortly about me:

I'm a poor little student who is living STILL with his parents with a hope of achieving something great in the future.
Of course the main problem is passing the studies but i think that with hard work and a bit of luck i can manage this B)

### Skills

* For now my skillset isn't satysfying, but hey I'm a student i'm still learning 
* I can program a bit in C++ and i'm learning C now
* Math has been always my domain but studies showed that it's not entirely true 
* And....**Somehow** i passed FCE in English, but shh..

### Project
